This is a place for those looking to discover Malta’s natural beauty and imagine how the islands were before mass tourism arrived. Despite its remote feel and unspoilt appearance Ramla is still a very popular summer beach. It is only a 25 minute hop to Gozo by ferry from the main island and a quick bus ride.

The beach itself ranges between 50 - 100 metres wide and is flat rather than sloping. This makes it safe, and is possible to walk far out into the surf, thanks to the shallow waters around Hout Bay’s shoreline. Four lifesavers keep watch in either direction along this long stretch of beach. Vendors ply their trade too, renting out beach chairs and selling refreshments. Swimming, sunbathing, surfing and strolling are among the popular pursuits, while various ball games keep the youth engaged.

The beach itself is fairly sandy but littered with large rocks close to the cliffs - which are in a constant state of erosion, so don’t put your towel down too close. Mohegan Bluffs Beach takes a little effort to get to and for this reason remains fairly quiet most days.

Whilst you might be tempted to take a dip here you should be aware there are often strong currents in the area and no lifeguards. A safer option is to relax and enjoy the peace or try spotting some of the varied marine life such as seals, dolphins and a variety of bird species.  It is said the name of the beach comes from a battle between the native American Niantic and Mohegan tribes that took place in the 16th century.

Apart from swimming and sun worship, this beach is popular for those who love to kite surf, and anglers who enjoy casting their lines along the shoreline. The remnants of the original timber jetty in the form of wooden poles mark the place where immigrants came ashore in numbers after the reestablishment of Israel at the end the Second World War. As well as offering a poignant reminder of Israel’s history the old wooden stumps make for a great photo opportunity. Just six-kilometres north of the city of Netanya, parking is plentiful near the kiosk and a per car entrance fee is levied by the Israel Parks and Nature Authorities. This covers the cost of providing lifeguards in season, as well as keeping the beach clean. Facilities include change rooms and showers along with a choice of restaurants from which to choose. Overnight camping is allowed, making it popular among campers in search of family-friendly, quiet, and spotlessly clean beaches.  The white sand beach and crystal blue water with a warm average temperature of 25°c (77°f), makes for pleasant bathing during the long summer season. Three beaches - Nuweiba, Mikhmoret and Beit Yanai - link up to provide a 5 km (3-mile) stretch of pristine sand overlooking the crystal clear waters of the Mediterranean. Beit Yanai Beach is one of the leading beaches for kite surfing along this coast, and attracts surfers from all over Israel and beyond.

The only thing to be thankful about is the earthquake happened during one of the quietest periods of the year, although two local women died as a result of the quake. 2019 Update Egremni beach is set to be open to the public XXXXXonce again.

Although it’s a tough call, in terms of sheer wow factor, Kelingking Beach is possibly the best on the little island. The competition is pretty stiff with spots like Atuh and Suwehan beach being jaw-droppingly beautiful, but if Instagram is the ultimate arbiter then Kelingking takes the crown. Kelingking beach goes by several names including Secret Point beach and more recently T-Rex beach. Both these names refer to the dramatic headland which defines the beach’s character. It is hard to say whether the T-Rex moniker is due to the headland looking like the claw or head of a Tyrannosaurus, but it seems to have stuck. The beach itself sits at the bottom of some extremely tall (around 200m / 500ft), white limestone cliffs. With plenty of vegetation, near-white sand and almost iridescent blue sea this beach is a tropical stunner. The drawback is those very same cliffs which make the beach so spectacular - if you want to do more than take in the view then you are going to have to make the climb down (and up!). There are steps, and there is a railing, but it is a fair climb and not for the faint of heart. One of the great things about Kelingking beach is that unlike so many other spots where the view is stunning but the beach just and after-thought, the beach here is great too. A good-sized strip of smooth sand and a backdrop to die for. It should be noted that swimming here can be dangerous. The waves and currents are often extremely powerful and if you’re not a strong swimmer don’t risk it on all but the calmest of days.  In terms of amenities there is pretty much nothing on the beach, however some local food-sellers do make the trip down to the beach to sell snacks.

As if that wasn’t enough, El Nido is the largest marine sanctuary in the Philippines with turtles, sea cows and whale sharks all native.

The level arc of sand circles a shallow sea lagoon of extraordinary clarity, and is backed by a fusion of palms and rocks busy with birdsong. The only access to the beach is a quick swim, some of it over corals, adding to the feeling of arriving somewhere truly special. While growing in popularity, Hidden Beach’s isolated location means it’s rarely crowded, and those that do come tend to spend only around an hour here as part of a wider tour of the island’s treasures despite the obvious beauty.

It is little wonder that Bora Bora claims to be the world’s most idyllic tropical island, far away in the ocean blue down South Pacific way. When you step ashore on this island, you will soon discover Matira beach, the island’s most popular public stretch of sand by far. The beach is less than a mile in length, starting out from Hotel Mataria in the north, and ending at Matira Point at the southern-most tip of Bora Bora. Nestling in the lush tropical vegetation beyond the beach you will find a row of upmarket resorts and grand hotels for chilling out in style. The dazzling white sands of Matira beach slope gradually to meet the gently lapping waves of the lagoon, where the water is shallow and warm. The lagoon floor is flat with nothing but sand under foot - well, perhaps the occasional inquisitive marine inhabitant. This means Matira is particularly safe for young families, with the usual caveat of keeping a watchful eye over the young ones. When the tide is low, you can wade from Matira Point, across the shallows and even out to the barrier reef. There are plenty of activities to engage the energetic visitor, including diving and shark feeding. For the less active, the best recommendation is to enjoy lazing the day away on a secluded stretch of Matira Beach until the tropical sun sets over the turquoise waters.

However, you don’t have to go to far off the beaten track to still find a pristine gem and the island of Koh Kradan is home to just such a beach.This stunning stretch of powdery white sand remain a relative haven despite being only a few kilometres off the mainland.  Ko Kradan is one of the Trang Islands, a group of around 40 large and small islands which form a major part of the Hat Chao Mai national park. Of all these islands and islets Koh Kradan is perhaps the most beautiful and largely unspoilt. Despite only being a couple of hours south of Phuket and even closer to Koh Phi Phi, Koh Kradan is a world apart, sharing all the natural beauty but without the crowds and noise. The waters of the Andaman Sea which surround the island are relatively sheltered and shallow, which means they are always warm i.e. ideal for swimming. On top of that they are crystal clear making for some excellent snorkelling in the protected waters. One thing to note though is the water is very shallow here at low tide and you’ll have to paddle quite a way before it’s deep enough to swim properly.\nFor those feeling particularly energetic there is a popular kayak route around the island which can be completed in less than 3 hours, even at a leisurely pace. For those looking to just relax and soak up the sun and calm Koh Kradan is perfect. There are numerous hammocks suspended between the palm trees that fringe the beach. The main beach at Koh Kradan is the aptly named east facing Paradise beach. However there is another, equally appropriately named, beach on the other coast. Easily reachable by a short trail through the forest is Sunset beach where you can enjoy a peaceful view of the sun setting over the Andaman Sea. Getting to Ko Kradan involves taking one of the ubiquitous long-tailed boats and these are available from several locations on the mainland or many of the other islands.
