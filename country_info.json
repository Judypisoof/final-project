Located between the resort beaches of Drymades and Himara the beach at Gjipe has barely been touched by development. Obscured by the mountainous terrain, the beach here sits at the end of the Gjipe Canyon, an impressive natural feature with the rock formations reaching up to 70 metres high in some places. If you fancy it you can hike for a couple of kilometres up the canyon, but it is relatively hard going. To get to the beach is a bit of a hike and this helps keep the beach relatively quiet even in the depths of summer.  Like with other beaches on the Albanian Riviera, Gjipe has warm crystal clear azure water with the beach itself consisting of fine white pebbles. Despite its seclusion and the 20 minute walk down to the beach there are a few basic facilities including sun loungers and parasols. There is also a small wagon selling snacks and drinks. At present the Albanian Riviera is only just coming to the attention of the wider world and Gjipe beach is still off the tourist radar.

Perhaps the most iconic feature on the beach is the Art Deco Indiana Teahouse building; upstairs is a restaurant whilst downstairs is home to the surf lifesaving club. There are plenty of other restaurants, cafes and bars overlooking the beach along Marine Parade. But it is the sea that people flock here for and the crystal clear, turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean will not disappoint.  Cottesloe is a great spot for practically any type of watersport from swimming to surfing. It is from here that the biggest open water swimming event in the world is held - the 20km Rottnest Channel Swim. Apparently this dates back to the days when Rottnest Island was a prison and inmates would try to escape by swimming the channel to the mainland.", "near_town_or_city": "Perth", "weather": {"description": "(Clear sky)", "temperature": "21°C / 70°F", "sea-temperature": "21°C69.8°F"}, "rating": "Rating: 4.5/5 (2 votes cast)", "near_beaches": ["Swanbourne Beach (1.3 mi)", "Mosman Beach (1.6 mi)", "Leighton Beach (2.3 mi)", "Port Beach (2.8 mi)", "City Beach (3.9 mi)", "Bathers Beach (4.4 mi)", "Floreat Beach (4.5 mi)", "South Beach (5.4 mi)", "Como Beach (6 mi)", "C Y O'Connor Beach (6.4 mi)"], "country_rank": 18}, "Byron Bay Main Beach": {"country": "Australia", "name": "Byron Bay Main Beach", "description": "Byron Bay is situated in the far north of New South Wales and on the very eastern tip of Australia - Cape Byron is the easternmost point of mainland Australia. This small beach town was put on the tourism map back in the 1970s when it was on the hippy trail later becoming a popular backpacker destination. It is to a large extent the legacy of Byron’s early days that set it apart from other spots along this beautiful stretch of coast. Whether the actual beaches in and around Byron Bay are any better than those a little way up or down the coast is a moot point, it is the whole package that makes this a special place. Byron’s beaches are without doubt the town’s greatest asset and there are a few to choose from all of which face into the the clear blue waters of the Pacific Ocean. And it’s easy to escape the summer crowds on Main Beach; the short walk to Tallow beach reveals 7 km of pristine sandy beach - more than enough to go around. There are also some quality surf spots in and around Byron Bay, most notable are Wategos, a long point-break favoured by longboarders, Lennox Head and “The Wreck” off Belongil Beach - a powerful wave best left to the real surfers! Whilst the trustafarians, wanna-be surf bums and barefoot sixties throw-backs might not be everyone’s cup of tea Byron is still is a great place. For starters the developers haven’t been allowed free reign as in places like Surfer’s Paradise up the coast. So there are no high rise blocks and the town pretty much blends into the vegetation that lines the beach. Over recent years the town has definitely shifted a little upmarket, but to date this seems to happily coexist with the backpackers etc and has not affected the laid back vibe of the place.\nA couple of words of warning though, watch out for schoolies week (end of November) when the town can become inundated with drunken teenagers celebrating the end of high school.

Generally it’s ideal for all types of watersports as the waters are calm and safe. Swimming, snorkelling, scuba diving, kayaking and paddleboarding can all be enjoyed here, so bring your kit! It’s also good for rock fishing. The surf tends to pick up in the late summer and autumn when the wind is light and from the southwest. However, those prime swells can get pretty crowded and you need to keep your eyes peeled for occasional rips, rocks and sea urchins as well as other surfers. At other times, the lower waves are suitable for novice surfers. For non-surfers, Malabar Beach has some fun features including a saltwater rock pool big enough for swimming. Cromwell Park backs onto the beach and has an excellent playground for youngsters, hence its popularity. Coir matting provides easy access to the beach for wheelchairs and strollers. Although there is a lifeguard tower, the beach is currently not patrolled. Facilities include toilets, showers, changing rooms and there’s a handy boat ramp which is used by the Offshore Rescue Boat.

Initially it was the site of a working mens’ camp and females were only allowed to visit on Sundays. Tents gave way to huts and after WWI, new lodges were built to attract working class families. It acquired the name “Camp City” and was only renamed Freshwater Beach in 1980. A tunnel was blasted through the rock, connecting Manly with Freshwater and is known as the Wormhole. Rock falls have made it more of a scramble than a stroll but the original path still exists. Freshwater Beach has established sandbanks which make for consistent waves right along the beach. It is protected from nor’easter storms by the north headland. History has it that Freshwater Beach is where surfboarding first became popular. Hawaiian surfer, “Duke” Kahanamoku carved a board from a piece of local timber and mesmerized the crowds with his surfing prowess. That was in January 1915 and his statue on the north headland commemorates that significant day. There’s a popular 50m saltwater swimming pool at one end of the beach with lanes for lap swimmers.

Since there are no private motor vehicles allowed on the island, the white sands of Salmon Bay are normally reached by bus or by bicycle. However, the most attractive way to reach this stretch of Rottnest coastline, should time permit, is by following at least some part of the Wadjemup Bidi hiking trail. This takes in some of the island’s best landscapes, including its inland lakes and attractive coastal reaches.

Backed by forested hills, Cow Bay Beach is a broad expanse of golden sand curving into three coves which are separated by rocks at high tide. These rocks form a popular spot for anglers, while the bay’s inshore reefs make it a favourite place for snorkelling and scuba diving too. A lack of rip currents and the gentle surf makes swimming another option, although there is no lifeguard service at any time of year. A handful of picnic benches are situated below an iron shelter. They are are free to use by any of the small number of visitors who make it to Cow Bay Beach. There are no other facilities on the beach itself. If you’re very lucky, you may get to witness sea cows (dugong) feeding on the underwater seagrasses of the bay. Some suggest it’s these creatures which gave the beach its name. Give these animals plenty of space, and avoid the temptation to touch them if you do encounter them. Others believe the name comes from the township’s early history in cattle grazing.

eastern coast of Brazil is home to many fantastic beaches. However, it is Baia do Sancho that takes the crown of, not only the finest beach on the island, but possibly the best beach in Brazil. That’s pretty good going considering there are well over 2,000 other great beaches in Brazil. What gives the beach at Baia do Sancho a head start over many on the mainland is the fact these islands are a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site. With development pretty much outlawed there are only facilities for around 700 visitors at any one time on the island. Even if all these tourists were evenly divided amongst the island’s 20 beaches that would make for very thin crowds. But most of Fernando de Noronha’s other beaches are much easier to get to than Baia do Sancho meaning you can enjoy this pristine beach with barely another soul. So what makes Baia do Sancho such a great beach? Well to start with the crystal clear blue water, which are encompassed within a National Marine Park, is teeming with sealife including turtles, hundreds of species of fish and dolphins. This makes it one of the premiere diving destinations in Brazil.\nVisually, the beach here is stunning. The crescent of soft white sand lies at the foot of 230 feet (70 m) high rugged cliffs which are covered in lush vegetation. These cliffs are home to any number of birds which nest here and the beach is home to the highest concentration of tropical seabirds to be found on this side of the Atlantic. As you might have guessed there isn’t much in the way of facilities at Baia do Sancho, but that’s not why you come here. Oh, and just a note about getting to the beach; access involves a hike along dirt tracks followed by climbing a series of rickety ladders and squeezing through an opening in the rocks. Those who have made the effort though, are in no doubt it was worth it.", "near_town_or_city": "Fernando de Noronha (Distrito Estadual)", "weather": {"description": "(Partly cloudy)", "temperature": "26°C / 79°F", "sea-temperature": "27.4°C81.4°F"}, "rating": "Rating: 4/5 (1 votes cast)", "near_beaches": ["Baía dos Porcos (0.3 mi)", "Praia da Cacimba do Padre (0.5 mi)", "Praia do Leão (1.1 mi)", "Baía do Sueste (1.5 mi)", "Praia do Meio (2.4 mi)"], "country_rank": 1}, "Lopes Mendes Beach": {"country": "Brazil", "name": "Lopes Mendes Beach", "description": "Of all the beautiful beaches on Ilha Grande, it is Praia de Lopes Mendes that is perhaps the closest to perfection.

The beach itself is a gorgeous expanse of fine golden sand which stretches for 3 Km along the clear, blue waters of the Atlantic Ocean. What makes this beach so special are its stunning and pristine surrounds. Lopes Mendes Beach is fringed with almond and palm trees, but beyond these the terrain rises rapidly. To one side of the beach is the 350 m high Morro dos Castelhanos, whilst to the other the 760 m high Morro do Ferreira. All this landscape is covered in thick greenery, and there isn’t a sign of human existence as far as the eye can see. Besides relaxing and taking in the beauty of the scenery the main activity at Lopes Mendes is surfing.

You won’t be disappointed, except for the setting, because Rio’s southern latitude - just north of the Tropic of Capricorn - means it is merely sub-tropical. However, that never stopped anyone and Ipanema is still the crowning glory of Rio de Janeiro’s many famous attractions for fun-loving, sun-worshipping beach enthusiasts.  Ipanema is sandwiched between the equally fabulous Leblon and Copacabana beaches to the west and north respectively, making this combined stretch of sand one of the best known around the world. In this Latino city of pulsating action, life is centred around the beach.  Visitors and locals like to pass the day lapping up the sun, plunging into the surf, or just watching the world and his wife pass by. Beach lovers will have no shortage of beach gear to hire - brightly coloured beach chairs and umbrellas for example. For the thirsty, sales of “bem gelada” (very cold) Brazilian beer are available at designated spots. No worries about the large crowds that flock to Ipanema on a hot day, because the beach frontage is generously wide and plenty long enough (4.3 miles / 6.9 km). The area is clean and well maintained. Ipanema Beach fronts the affluent suburb bearing the same name (except for the “beach” bit) and this seafront area is the favoured destination for Rio’s trendy and wealthy. Accommodation and shops abound in the area, and there are more bars, cafes and restaurants than you will ever get around to sampling - if you do like bars, be sure to track down Garota de Ipanema. Keep in mind that the Ipanema area only really wakes up after dark with its nightlife a major attraction, making it very popular among the high society of Rio de Janeiro.

Situated on the northeastern tip of the island, Morro de São Paulo achieved importance because it guarded the important trade routes along the Itaparica Channel, which proved pivotal for trading throughout the region. During the early colonial period under Portuguese rule, the island witnessed many attacks by French and Dutch ships, not to mention pirates who delighted in taking on anyone and everyone for profit. Things these days are more civilized, though not much has changed around Morro de São Paulo, which has retained its charming Brazilian village character. The main difference is that the island has caught the tourist bug and is a growing destination resort. That said, boat or plane remain the only ways in and out of this village with no paved streets. This means no traffic problems - because there are no cars.  Morro’s beaches are among the main attractions and hold the names First, Second, Third and Forth (Primeira, Segunda, Terceira & Quarta) to make things simple. The setting is tropical, with clear blue Atlantic Ocean breakers rolling ashore upon pristine golden sands. What more could the stressed out visitor want? Shops line the path from the quaint harbour, with pousadas (guesthouses), restaurants and even a few ATMs in evidence. At the top of the hill - morro, in Portuguese - you will find a lighthouse and a viewing deck to witness superb sun risings and sun sets. The ancient fort is as imposing today as it was when it first sprung up (circa 1630). There are plenty of hotels and other accommodation options to make your visit to Morro de São Paulo memorable, with its magical getaway-beaches waiting to enchant you.", "near_town_or_city": "Valença", "weather": {"description": "(Clear sky)", "temperature": "29.2°C / 85°F", "sea-temperature": "27.2°C80.9°F"}, "rating": "Rating: 4/5 (1 votes cast)", "near_beaches": [], "country_rank": 4}, "Praia do Espelho": {"country": "Brazil", "name": "Praia do Espelho", "description": "Praia do Espelho is on the south coast of Bahia, between trendy Trancoso and laid back Caraíva. It is often cited as yet another contender to title of Brazil’s most beautiful beach. But with difficult access not too many visitors make it to this isolated and exclusive spot. Espelho is the Portuguese word for “mirror” and the beach gets this name because when the tide is low and the weather clear and sunny, there is a mirror-like effect, with the sunlight reflected off the water. If you miss out on this phenomenon it’s no big deal, it is just another beautiful beach and that’s good enough for us! The beach itself is long, carrying on indefinitely southwards. It has a definite tropical feel to it with a healthy fringing of palm trees along the base of the cliffs that line this beach.

It is however something of a mouthful even to Portuguese speakers so the beach is known as just ‘Jeri’ more often than not.  The names origin hints at the wealth of natural surroundings and Jeri is set within an area of national park.

Watersports are popular here and the same relentless winds that pile the sand into dunes makes for good windsurfing and kite-surfing. The sea is generally pretty calm and shallow, and there are Stand Up Paddle (SUP) boards available for hire. Besides just chilling out on the beach there is plenty of exploring to be done at Jeri. The nearby Lagoa do Paraíso is a lagoon of stunning turquoise water. It is set around a kilometre inland but with its surrounding white sands and dunes it feels more like a beach. One of the most popular pursuits here is lying in one of the hammocks suspended over the water. Jeri is one of only a handful of west-facing beaches in Brazil which makes it one of the best places to catch a sunset. In fact it is quite a big deal here and they even named the biggest sand dune on the beach after this. The Duna do Pôr do Sol (Sunset Dune) has become part of a daily ritual in which visitors ascend this mountain of sand to watch the sun disappear beyond the horizon. Once the setting of the sun has been celebrated tradition states you must descend the dune by the (steeper) front. To add a bit of fun you can do this on a wooden board known as an ‘esquibunda’. One of the things that has kept Jericoacoara special for so long is its remoteness. It is a fair drive from Fortaleza including the last few hours being off road.

From a historical perspective, the area has changed many times, from the Ancient Greeks to the Byzantines to the Ottomans, USSR, and Bulgarian governments. The area was the site of Soviet M-100 rocket launches during the height of the Cold War. Once you reach the beach itself, you won’t be disappointed. The soft sandy shores are sandwiched between the sparkling blue of the Black Sea and the deep greens of the pine groves behind. The beach is dotted with straw umbrellas and there are restaurants, cafés, and all the amenities you could ever want from this little slice of Bulgarian paradise.  Situated not far from the Turkish border the temperature here is perfect for the beach with the May to October average hovering between 16 and 27 °C.

Once you arrive, you’ll find lovely sun-kissed golden sand partly shaded by pine trees on the sloping cliffs behind. The area is a haven for wildlife and was declared a protected area by the Ministry of Environment in 1992. It is home to several species of endangered birds, including the golden eagle and black stork.  All of that makes Silistar Beach sound pretty idyllic despite the fact its name actually indicates anything but. “Silistar” is taken from the Greek word “syunlistareo” which means “location adjacent to robbers.” Sure enough, the beach is suspected to have been a haven for pirates in the ancient past.

Whilst the former are supposedly more appealing to famiies and revellers, the latter will attract more adventurous spirits. This is a generalization, of course, but one beach that stands out on the “wild” side of things is Irakli Beach. Located about 4 km from the nearby village of Banya and other idyllic Black Sea towns, Irakli Beach offers a great chance to see a part of the Bulgarian coast that has remained largely the same for centuries. The beach itself is a seemingly endless stretch of soft golden sand backing onto wooded hillsides which rise up from the coast. There is very little in the way of amenities here and the lack of development makes it an ideal spot for naturists. The area is notable for its rugged coastline, which underscores that reputation for it being “wild” and “untamed”. It also helps set it apart from the fine white and gold sandy beaches you’ll find elsewhere along the coast. The bay area near the beach follows a 3 km path near Cape Emine along a nature-dominated area with very little infrastructure.

A short path leads to the white sandy beach. The north entrance is best for wheelchair users and pushchairs. The beach itself is long, flat and sandy. It is dog-friendly and popular for surfing, stand-up paddleboarding, kite surfing and surf kayaking. There’s a surf school and the surf is suitable for beginners and experienced surfers in most conditions. The best waves occur at the south-facing end of the Chesterman Beach when there’s a southern swell while North Chesterman faces west and catches the west and northwest swells.  It’s a beautiful beach for long walks along the water’s edge with views of the forested coastline. There are caves and rock pools to explore and you can spot birds, whales and marine life.  Après surf activities include bonfires and barbecues, stargazing, kite-flying or exploring the rock caves and tidal pools edging the broad sandy strip. Look out for sand dollars and sea stars that frequently wash ashore. Parking (free) is on the street and at car parks on the corner of Chesterman Beach Road and at Lynn Road.

Picture a dazzling white sandy beach of around a kilometre long, contrasted by the shimmering blue Pacific gently caressing a pristine shore while you feel the cooling effects of the gentle sea breeze. A beautiful natural rainforest forms a green fringe right along the beach upper area, offering natural shade from the tropical sun. True, getting from the small town of Manuel Antonio to its beach involves a half-hour trek, and there is a modest entrance fee. What you will find on arrival is definitely heaven sent. Where else can you think of where you end up sharing this idyllic setting with some of the permanent residents of the park? This is a one-on-one with nature opportunity and the cast includes the likes of tree sloths, squirrel and capuchin monkeys, brilliantly coloured toucans and even some raucous racoons. The usual beach facilities are on offer. These including rest rooms, catering outlets and hire kiosks. Remember to leave your valuables back at you accommodation and don?t be alarmed if some of the park animals arrive to investigate your tasty morsels while you are cooling off in the sea. The white face monkeys are certainly not shy in coming forward. Manuel Antonio Beach can get quite hectic on a fine day, so staking out your patch early makes good sense. Pursuits range from various forms of water sports ? superb snorkelling on offer - to quiet frolicking in the warm, virtually wave-free ocean. Most visitors prefer to soak up the gorgeous sun on the gently sloping sand. Remember to be on your best behaviour when encountering the inquisitive locals and do resist the urge to feed them ? the rangers will soon remind you of the rules if you step out of line.

He envisioned the resort way back in 1925 and went on to develop it. This was thanks to the fortune he accumulated during the pioneering days of Texas oil discovery in the USA. Located just a ninety-minute drive southwest of Costa Rica’s main airport in San Jose, Jaco Beach is a 2 mile (3Km) long stretch of lovely golden sand between the resort town and the fabulous Pacific Ocean. Here, the order of the day is to relax on this beautiful beach, or ride the majestic waves when the surf is up. Playa Jaco in Golfo de Nicoya is a very open beach with little natural shade other than that offered by beach umbrellas. It does offer reliable surfing conditions when offshore winds sweep in from the northeast. Clean groundswells prevail and the best swell direction is from south / southwest. The beach break offers both left and right hand waves, which are good to test around the high tide mark.  If surfing is not your forte, then the beach area lends itself to relaxation in an idyllic setting, with bathing and sun worshipping offering viable alternatives to the more strenuous surfing option. Other pursuits offered in and around Jaco include paragliding and sea kayaking, as well as some of the most amazing deep sea fishing charters - these operate from nearby Playa Hermosa. In holiday season, Playa Jaco is a popular destination for city-dwellers from San Jose, as well as many visitors from North America. Canadians and Americans choose Costa Rica for its ease of access, particularly when they are suffering the chills of winter up north. With its pristine beach, Jaco is a favourite destination. This picture-perfect stretch of sand is one of several in the area and all offer splendid sunsets. Bathers should be aware that with the excellent surf come potential rip-tide conditions. Ask locals where the monitored safe zones are, before taking to the water when surf’s up.

The tranquil fishing village of Manzanillo forms part of impressive Gandoca-Manzanillo Wildlife and Marine Refuge.

It is best to swim between mid and high tide due to the danger posed by concealed rocks when the water recedes. Manzanillo Beach certainly lives up to its tropical paradise billing with the extra appeal of an amazing coral reef offshore. This is the perfect spot for snorkelling although scuba diving spots are open to visitors with the relevant diving skills.

To get there, you’ll need to either make your way through a dense nearby forest or take a boat. The lack of a road only adds to the area’s natural ambience, making it a truly unspoiledslice of nature. Whether you’re looking to take a stroll on the beach or take in the full grandeur of the sea from the clifftops, Nugal Beach lets you see all, bare all, and be all you want to be.", "near_town_or_city": "Tučepi", "weather": {"description": "(Rain)", "temperature": "14°C / 57°F", "sea-temperature": "16.9°C62.4°F"}, "rating": "Rating: 3/5 (1 votes cast)", "near_beaches": ["Sveti Petar (1.7 mi)", "Dracevac beach (2.3 mi)", "Cvitačka (2.8 mi)", "FKK - Cvitacka (3.2 mi)", "Rat (5.5 mi)", "Vodice (5.6 mi)", "Soline (5.7 mi)", "Izbitac (5.9 mi)", "Tila Lucica (6 mi)", "Urania Beach (6.6 mi)"], "country_rank": 12}, "Sveti Ivan Beach": {"country": "Croatia", "name": "Sveti Ivan Beach", "description": "Sveti Ivan, or St John’s Beach (and sometimes Lubenice Beach), lies on the island of Cres. It is one of the string of islands in the Istria Peninsula. Ferries can be caught from the mainland at Brestova, and make the trip more than a dozen times a day in the high season. Named as one of the top 40 beaches in the world by German magazine Bild, Sveti Ivan is a family-orientated virgin beach, meaning it can be found just as nature intended, if with no amenities of any sort. Located in an attractive cove at the base of steep cliffs below Lubenice village, its 150-metre length and pebbled surface is protected from strong winds, making it a fun place to swim with the kids. However, limited parking in Lubenice, and the steep descent of almost 400 metres makes reaching Sveti Ivan by land a difficult process. It can take up to 40 minutes down to the beach and an hour back up to your car. All told, it’s therefore better to reach Sveti Ivan by water taxi, which can be boarded from Cres and Valun towns, or private boat charter. Pets are allowed on Sveti Ivan Beach.", "near_town_or_city": "Opatija", "weather": {"description": "(Light rain)", "temperature": "14°C / 57°F", "sea-temperature": "15.3°C59.6°F"}, "rating": "Rating: 3/5 (1 votes cast)", "near_beaches": ["Sipar (0.5 mi)", "Beach (1.3 mi)", "Cesarova (2.5 mi)", "Medveja (2.9 mi)", "Brsec beach (3.2 mi)", "Plaža Ika (5.5 mi)", "Dog beach (6.5 mi)", "Stara Porozina (6.7 mi)", "Plaža Tomaševac (8.1 mi)", "Plaža Škrbici (8.2 mi)"], "country_rank": 13}, "Cvitačka Beach": {"country": "Croatia", "name": "Cvitačka Beach", "description": "Situated about 2km from Makarska town centre is Cvitačka beach.

Not exactly perfect for walking on, but looks idyllic and is the reason the water is so clear along this coast. The beach itself is quite idyllic with the local pine forest reaching right down to the “sand”. It’s also fairly recognisable with the man-made jetty in the middle of the beach. Being so close to a resort town means there are plenty of facilities at Cvitačka. It also means it can get quite busy and loud in the summer months. In addition to a selection of bars and cafes there are plenty of places to rent equipment for diving, paddleboarding or even jet-skiing.

To reach Murvica visitors then need to follow the steep path down the cliff. Though only 150 metres long by approximately five metres wide, Murvica Beach is rarely overcrowded.

The largest of Dubrovnik’s beaches at 200 metres in length, Copacabana is a popular choice with families because of the shallow entrance into the warm glistening waters, and the huge number of amenities and activities available to keep young minds entertained. On the rounded pebbles themselves visitors will discover a children’s water park, and facilities for both volleyball and tennis. But it’s in the water that Copacabana really excels itself, with water sports as diverse as paddle boating, jet skiing, parasailing and kayaking all on offer here. What’s more, Copacabana Beach has a good number of food options without the need to travel very far, alongside toilets, changing rooms, outdoor showers, and sunbeds and parasols for hire. Copacabana also has facilities for those with difficulty moving, with a sea lift to take people in and out of the water on a level section of concrete.

These days the island is mostly national park and a  conservation area thus protecting it from future development. The island is home to a pretty little village with a church. The only other structures of note on the island are a lighthouse and a fort. There are other beautiful beaches on Porquerolles but Notre Dame is special as it a little further off the beaten track. Of course you need to take a boat from Hyères (between Marseille and Cannes) to get to any of the beaches on Porquerolles but you’ll need to make just a little more effort to get here.

Not only does it move up to 5 metres every year, but it’s also estimated to contain an incredible sixty million cubic metres of fine sand. Rising above the trees, the dune has become a popular launching point for paragliders, who are then able to take in the full magnificence of this natural spectacle. Reaching its top is relatively easy, thanks to a roped stairway which is open to the public throughout the summer. From the summit, the view stretches as far as Cap Ferrat.

On quieter days, outside the summer holidays, the beach could almost be described as secluded, with its backdrop of trees reminiscent of jungle foliage. However, mid-season the masses descend in their thousands to see and be seen. Presumably the name of the beach was inspired by the near white sand and crystalline turquoise water which give this place something of a feel of a tropical paradise.  Tahiti Beach’s fame dates back to the 1950s when Brigitte Bardot’s And God Created Woman (Et Dieu… Créa La Femme) hit the silver screen. In the film the Plage de Tahiti features in a raunchy scene. The film was a big, if not slightly controversial, hit. Prior to this Tahiti Beach was best known as the site of the Allied landings in 1944. Possibly off the back of Bardot’s example Tahiti became one of a growing number of naturist beaches across France. Driven by the liberation and drive for equality that defined the 1960s Plage de Tahiti became a place where women could go topless (just like the men) and, in fact, everyone could go bottomless too if they so desired. And whilst Tahiti remains one of the most iconic nude beaches in France the majority of naturists opt for somewhere a little more private these days. Plage de Tahiti is regarded as one of the coolest spots in Saint Tropez and as such attracts a fairly chique crowd.

It lies to the northwest of the bigger islands of Taha’a and Tahiti, in French Polynesia. Encircled by sand-fringed islets, this paradisiacal island is protected from the swells of the greater ocean. A stunning turquoise lagoon holds centre stage as a natural swimming area, within a magnificent coral reef to boot. It is little wonder that Bora Bora claims to be the world’s most idyllic tropical island, far away in the ocean blue down South Pacific way. When you step ashore on this island, you will soon discover Matira beach, the island’s most popular public stretch of sand by far. The beach is less than a mile in length, starting out from Hotel Mataria in the north, and ending at Matira Point at the southern-most tip of Bora Bora. Nestling in the lush tropical vegetation beyond the beach you will find a row of upmarket resorts and grand hotels for chilling out in style. The dazzling white sands of Matira beach slope gradually to meet the gently lapping waves of the lagoon, where the water is shallow and warm. The lagoon floor is flat with nothing but sand under foot - well, perhaps the occasional inquisitive marine inhabitant. This means Matira is particularly safe for young families, with the usual caveat of keeping a watchful eye over the young ones. When the tide is low, you can wade from Matira Point, across the shallows and even out to the barrier reef. There are plenty of activities to engage the energetic visitor, including diving and shark feeding. For the less active, the best recommendation is to enjoy lazing the day away on a secluded stretch of Matira Beach until the tropical sun sets over the turquoise waters. After all, that is what you parted with all that money to come here for.

This spectacular setting is further enhanced by a small, typical Greek Orthodox chapel down in the cove and the ruins of the ancient Acropolis of Lindos set overlooking the cove.

Huge cliffs, carved by the elements, rise up from the beach and the ever changing sands vary in colour from white to black with yellows and reds thrown in for good measure. It is somewhat of an adventure to get to Rauðisandur and we’d recommend using someone else’s car as the roads are more like tracks.

You don’t have to go far to find accommodation, including both guest houses and higher-end hotels, while there are also numerous places to eat, drink and relax. They range from simple beachside shacks to bars and restaurants lining nearby roads, although nightlife at Colva Beach is minimal.

Stretching for approximately one kilometre in length, Baina beach is also quite wide, and flat, so is good for games of beach cricket. The only obstacle you might face if you do are attractive brightly-coloured fishing boats pulled above the high tide line.

you then hop on a boat and make the short trip over to the island of Nusa Penida, you won’t be disappointed. Although it’s a tough call, in terms of sheer wow factor, Kelingking Beach is possibly the best on the little island. The competition is pretty stiff with spots like Atuh and Suwehan beach being jaw-droppingly beautiful, but if Instagram is the ultimate arbiter then Kelingking takes the crown. Kelingking beach goes by several names including Secret Point beach and more recently T-Rex beach. Both these names refer to the dramatic headland which defines the beach’s character. It is hard to say whether the T-Rex moniker is due to the headland looking like the claw or head of a Tyrannosaurus, but it seems to have stuck. The beach itself sits at the bottom of some extremely tall (around 200m / 500ft), white limestone cliffs. With plenty of vegetation, near-white sand and almost iridescent blue sea this beach is a tropical stunner. The drawback is those very same cliffs which make the beach so spectacular - if you want to do more than take in the view then you are going to have to make the climb down (and up!). There are steps, and there is a railing, but it is a fair climb and not for the faint of heart. One of the great things about Kelingking beach is that unlike so many other spots where the view is stunning but the beach just and after-thought, the beach here is great too. A good-sized strip of smooth sand and a backdrop to die for. It should be noted that swimming here can be dangerous. The waves and currents are often extremely powerful and if you’re not a strong swimmer don’t risk it on all but the calmest of days.  In terms of amenities there is pretty much nothing on the beach, however some local food-sellers do make the trip down to the beach to sell snacks.

There are only a handful of pink beaches around the world with other notable ones in the Bahamas and on Lombok. However neither of these have quite the same degree of pinkness as Komodo Island’s Pink beach. Set in a small, south-facing bay the sand is only a small part of the beach’s appeal. Equally striking is the brilliant blue, crystalline water that laps the shoreline.  Although it seems a long way to travel just to kick back in the sun, Pink beach has such a relaxed feel to it you may not be able to resist. If you do feel compelled to do something more active you have a few choices. One is to take a hike up the hill that overlooks the beach ; here you will get the best views and photos of this unique place. Pink beach is also a great spot for snorkelling. The water is generally fairly calm and whilst the beach is perfectly sandy there are abundant coral reefs a little way off the shore. The colourful coral gardens are home to a variety of hard and soft corals, which in turn support a wealth of fish and other marine life. The sand gets its famous hue from microscopic organisms in coral called Foraminifera. These produce a red pigment which fuses with the calcium carbonated of the sand turning it pink.

Padang is said to be the best surf spot on the whole of Bali, but this is no place for beginners. This is an extremely powerful, barrelling wave that breaks over a very shallow coral reef.

Crystal Bay is one of the easiest beaches to get to once you are on Nusa Penida. There is now a good road from Toyapakeh harbor and it only takes around 15 minutes. Despite this it doesn’t really get busy here, partly because you are already a little out of the way on Nusa Penida and also because most people are off sightseeing on their day trip from Bali. The beach here is a lovely crescent of golden sand fringed with tall palm trees. The name comes from the beautifully clear blue water in the bay which is generally safe to swim in. With water so clear it is little surprise that Crystal Bay is rated the best diving site on Nusa Penida. You can snorkel over the coral just off the beach, but for more experienced divers this is a great spot for a number of exotic species such as manta rays, dolphins, turtles and even the elusive mola-mola (sunfish). Set in the middle of the bay is the limestone islet of Pulau Batumejinong. Atop the island, among the trees is a small temple and to the northern end a rock arch, which is clearly visible from the beach.

There are a few warungs (snack huts) set among the palm tree, as well as a interesting old temple. Facilities here are better than most beaches on the island.

It’s actually bigger than it looks and for this reason it attracts a fair few adrenaline junky cliff jumpers. All I can say is if you do want to jump, check the water is deep enough and remember the nearest hospital is half a day away! The beach itself is a small, sheltered crescent of pale-golden sand set in what feels like a giant amphitheatre of lush greenery. Behind the sand is large flat area of grass with a smattering of palm trees. One thing to take into account is the state of the tide when you visit. To experience Pantai Atuh at its best you should head here for high tide. At low tide the reef in front of the sand is exposed and the view is considerably less photogenic. It also means you will have to navigate your way across the rocks before you find enough water to swim or snorkel. On the plus side, low tide does reveal a host of pools that are teaming with marine life. If you are visiting Atuh beach then it goes without saying that you should at least take a look at Diamond beach. The quickest way to do this is by taking the path up the headland at the southern end of the beach. Admittedly you need to be half goat to do this but the drive is surprisingly convoluted. Whilst the dramatic scenery at Diamond beach might swing it in the Instagram stakes, the laid back charms of Atuh make it our personal preference.

For the Bukit Peninsula it is something of a hidden gem, although it isn’t really that much of a secret anymore. Even so, being a little off-the-beaten-track keeps it pretty quiet and usually there are just a handful of beachgoers and surfers trying to avoid the crowds. That said, things could have been different. In the not too distant past developers did try to drag the Green Bowl into line with the rest of the coast and built a resort complete with elevator down to the beach. That didn’t work out and things soon returned to the way they always had been. Much of the beaches appeal is down to its feeling of remoteness. The steeply rising lush, jungle of vegetation to the rear of the beach certainly reinforces this. During the 70 metre descent through the trees you are likely to spot some of the resident monkeys and traditional stone statues. But why is it called Green Bowl beach? To tell you the truth we aren’t sure but there are a few theories. Some say it is the shape of the beach and how it fills up at high tide, others say it is the colour of the seaweed that clings to the rocks at low tide. However we prefer another theory. This refers to the bowl-shaped caves in the limestone cliffs at the back of the beach. The caves offer some welcome shade from the midday sun and are also home to small Balinese Hindu shrines. Green Bowl (or Greenball) is a fairly well known surf spot. It isn’t in the same league as the waves on the west coast but it can get good and is less busy. The beach is more exposed to the swells which has its pros and cons; ideal when the waves are small, but not so at any other time. This also makes swimming somewhat riskier at Green Bowl.

Some days you will see the odd surfer out here, but it isn’t one for the beginners. Nyang Nyang is always quiet, if you go early there’s a good chance you’ll have it to yourself.

This means there is something of a climb down but things have improved since the days when the only access was a rope ladder. Now-a-days there are around 100 concrete steps leading down to the beach, but it is still a fair climb. Despite being surf-central the shore here is protected from the waves by the coral reef over which they break.

An almost perfect circle of tall limestone cliffs surround a shallow pool of turquoise water. I say almost perfect as this beach is “broken”, in fact the Balinese name for the beach is Pasih Uug, meaning “damaged beach”. So what is broken about this beach? Well this could refer to the impressive rock arch that links the beach to the sea, or it could refer to the entire beach which resembles a giant hole in earth. Either way it’s a pretty spectacular spot. This is particularly true when there is a heavy swell running and the waves crash through the rock arch whipping the otherwise blue waters into a cauldron of white. The again on calm days it is equally stunning with the crystal clear water lapping the white sand at the foot of the cliff. There is just one thing that puts a bit of a dampener on this iconic spot - you can’t get down to the beach. OK, it’s possible by boat, but trying on any but the calmest of days would be insanity. That said most visitors are here for the photo opportunities, of which there are many. Just make sure you get here early or you’ll have to queue. Alternatively this west facing beach is a great spot for sunsets. So how was Broken beach formed? There are a couple of possibilities;  the first tells of a village that once found a cow. Not knowing who it belonged to they cooked it up and ate it. Anyway, to cut a long story short the owner came back and the villagers lied about the cow. The punishment was an earthquake and they all fell down the hole. The moral of the story - don’t lie about eating someone else’s cow.

Both beaches are equally stunning, but this one is considerably easier to get to, although it is still a bit of an adventure. Pink beach is found on a little peninsula in the far southeastern corner of Lombok, around an hour and a half’s travel from Kuta. As the name suggests there is a definite pink hue to the sand and this contrasts with the clear aquamarine of the Indian Ocean.  The pinkness of the sand is down to a tiny coral creature - the red foram. They have red shells and occur in such abundance that when they cast off their shells or die, the resulting fragments mix with the white sand to turn it pink. The pinkness of the sand varies according to whether it is wet or not and the angle of the light hitting it. Apparently the best time to visit for maximum pinkness is towards high tide. This also has the bonus of being the best time to swim too. Facing northwards the beach is reasonably sheltered from the swell so it is usually safe to swim here. There’s plenty of coral a little way offshore which makes it good for snorkelling too. Be aware that there is an entry fee to Pink beach and it is a little on the steep side by Indonesian standards.

The vistas are stark and spectacular from Ein Gedi, which overlooks the opaque waters of the Dead Sea right across to the sun-bleached mountains of Jordan. The altitude at surface level of the Dead Sea is a staggering 423 metres / 1,388 feet below sea level. This makes it the lowest land and surface water on planet Earth. Ein Gedi public beach offers dramatic east-facing views over the therapeutic waters of the Dead Sea, with the incredible mountain backdrops behind the resort, to the west, adding impact. Here, free access to the magical soda waters is open 24/7. Once you overcome the surreal feeling of bobbing belly-up between the crusty soda mounds in the intensely saline water (34% salinity), the freshwater showers are something to look forward to when you are done and dusted. Try encrusting yourself in the free mud mix before floating effortlessly out to sea, dodging natural obstructions on your way to the swim of a lifetime. Gentle backstroke is the only way to move around these waters. It is said that chemicals found naturally in the local mud help treat and even cure a long-list of skin issues, psoriasis being one of them. The Dead Sea climate offers year-round sunny skies and dry air. It has less than 50 millimetres / 2 inches of annual rainfall, and a summer average temperature between 32 and 39 °C (90 and 102 °F). Winter average temperatures range between 20 and 23 °C (68 and 73 °F). The average water temperature varies between 20 and 32 °C (68 and 90 °F - February and August respectively. This means it is ideal to visit any time of the year. Three atmospheric layers - including a natural evaporation screen positioned above the Dead Sea - help protect visitors from harmful effects of ultraviolet rays.

In this respect the lush verdant hills and pristine beaches in the north of Israel have a lot to offer. Here, we check out Achziv Beach, a lovely strip of sand on Israel’s northern coastline some 5 kilometres / approximately 3 miles north of the city of Nahariya. This follows the coastal road leading to Rosh Hanikra and eventually the Lebanese border. Achziv Beach will most definitely appeal to the beach connoisseur as it offers magical coves and enchanting lagoons set within natural surroundings of the Achziv National Park, quite a contrast to the more ‘fleshy’ beaches down Tel Aviv way. Here, you can witness turtles making their way safely to the ocean - they even lay their eggs along Achziv Beach in the warmer summer months between May and September.  While some may object to paying an entrance fee to enjoy the beach, few would mind the donation to experience the main Achziz strip. Apart from the pristine sand and the inviting clear waters of the Mediterranean Sea, you can search out beautiful sea anemones, urchins, starfish and even young octopi in and around the rock pools. Visit the ruins of the ancient settlement of Achziv date back to the Talmud times of Israel between the second to the fifth centuries CE. In the 1970s Achziv was firmly established on the hippy trail with visitors coming from all over Europe to party on the beaches here. In those days Achziv was well known for ‘Achzivland’, a plot of land here owned by Eli Aviv who declared it an independent nation - you could even get your passport stamped on entry. Well, Achzivland still exists and you can still get your passport stamped but now-a-days there is a hostel and museum here too. If you are considering camping overnight, you will find well-kept lawns and all the facilities you would expect, including good beach access - it will cost around 60 shekels per adult. If you enjoy walking, the promenade leading to Rosh Hanikra provides an excellent vantage point for the incredible sunsets for which Israel’s western coastline is so famous.\nLifeguards are on duty on Achziz Beach in holiday season and visitors will find plenty of eateries closeby, or you can hire local BBQ facilities to grill your favourite meats to perfection.

The view from the ocean surface is pretty impressive too.  This special sanctuary is a small but fascinating section of the Red Sea’s reef system, teeming with colourful, exotic fish and sea creatures.

The beach at Maiori is in fact the longest stretch of unbroken sand on the whole Amalfi Coast.  Both beaches back onto historic fishing villages which cling to the infeasibly steep hillsides rising up from the beach. Minori is the prettier of the two, but this is in part due to much of Maiori’s historic centre being destroyed by floods in the 1950s. Minori is also home to an ancient Roman villa (the Villa Marittima Romana) - this area was popular with tourists even back then. The villa is remarkably well preserved and is well worth tearing yourself away from the beach to visit, as is the church of Santa Trofimena.  But enough of the culture! What about Minori’s beach? The beach is around 250 metres long and faces southwards into the clear blue Mediterranean.

At the western end of the beach there is a long pier where you can take a stroll or get on a boat trip along the beautiful coast.  Just around the corner is Maiori beach; nearly 1 km of sandy beach.

If you fancy a break from catching the rays, then it’s well worth the hilly climb to reach the top, with birds-eye views over the beach and across the waters. As for the beach itself, it’s a sand-and-shingle swathe that’s particularly popular with families and rarely gets too packed. Many of the beachgoers here are locals taking it easy, so if you’re looking for quiet and secluded then this place hits the spot. There are parasols and umbrellas to hire, and lifebuoys dotted along the beach too.  And when it comes to food and drink, there are plenty of places dotted along the front, from coffee shops to pizzerias, and of course, fresh seafood restaurants. And if nothing next to the beach takes your fancy, it’s barely a 10-minute stroll into town, where you’ll find a whole load more bars, restaurants and ice-cream parlours. ", "near_town_or_city": "Scilla", "weather": {"description": "(Partly cloudy)", "temperature": "19.3°C / 67°F", "sea-temperature": "19.3°C66.7°F"}, "rating": "Rating: 3/5 (0 votes cast)", "near_beaches": ["Spiaggia di Marinella (6 mi)", "Lido di Catona (6.2 mi)", "Cala Leone (8.1 mi)", "Spiaggia della Marinella (9.6 mi)", "Spiaggia di Trachini (11.8 mi)", "Spiaggia di Marmora (13.1 mi)", "Spiaggia di Orto Luizzo (13.8 mi)", "Punta Pellaro (16.6 mi)"], "country_rank": 56}, "San Nicola Arcella Beach": {"country": "Italy", "name": "San Nicola Arcella Beach", "description": "This small seaside town sits in Italy’s sleepy south west, and its main beach is a top-notch spot for some serious chill time.

Facilities-wise, there are a handful of umbrellas - it’s worth reserving them in advance as they’re fairly limited in number. You’ll also find showers and changing cabins here, and there’s a snack bar for light bites, small plates and drinks - bear in mind that it’s the only place to grab supplies from, so fussy eaters may want to bring their own snacks and drinks. The pretty town centre’s around a 20-minute walk away, and while the scenery’s stunning, it’s a fairly challenging, winding and hilly walk. Once you reach town, you’ll find plenty of places to grab drinks and food, including a number of pizzerias. Back at the beach, if you fancy a break from sunbathing, you can climb up to the Torre Crawford at the end of the beach. The Crawford Tower, as it’s known in English, is a centuries-old fortress that was renamed after the American author, Francis Marion Crawford, who lived there in the early 20th century, and set some of his novels in the area.

Nicknamed “Aka”, this is a popular holiday destination from both Okinawa and the mainland. Situated roughly midway between the northern tip of Taiwan and mainland Japan’s southern-most point, Aka enjoys a near tropical climate. It has a permanent population of just over 300 residents which it shares with its southern neighbour, Geruma Island.  Access to Aka is by means of frequent ferry crossings between Okinawa Main Island (Tomarin Port) and the Kerama Island Group. This takes either 60 to 90 minutes by ferry depending on whether you catch a fast or slow connection. Once you arrive on the island bicycles are the favoured way of getting around Aka. The ocean surrounding Akajima feeds off the Kuroshio Current, which means healthy coral reefs and a rich diversity of sea life. Diving is the perhaps the biggest attraction around Aka, as it is in most parts of Okinawa. Coral reefs surround most of the islands, with calm waters and abundant colourful tropical fish. High season is from April to October and the off-season runs from November to March. There is also much interest in the area from late December through to early April, as this is the breeding season for humpback whales. Of the island’s beaches Nishibama beach is possibly the best. A stunning powder-white stretch of soft sand (crushed coral) along a clear turquoise shoreline. It is about a 30-minute bike-ride northeast of the ferry terminal situated at the southern tip of the island of Akajima. Once you reach the beach, you can rent snorkelling equipment for around 1,000 Yen or less than $10 US.  Locals are quick to point out that Nishibama beach forms part of a nature reserve, meaning snorkelling is restricted to designated areas. It is not a good idea to step on coral for several reasons; in fact, the local lifeguards have very loud megaphones to warn offending bathers. Snorkelers can enjoy viewing many fish varieties without having to swim far from the shore. If you want to have a car-free beach holiday, this destination is the perfect place to arrive by ferry, and go exploring on foot or bicycle.

This is a place for those looking to discover Malta’s natural beauty and imagine how the islands were before mass tourism arrived. Despite its remote feel and unspoilt appearance Ramla is still a very popular summer beach. It is only a 25 minute hop to Gozo by ferry from the main island and a quick bus ride.

Besides taking in the scenery, going for a dip in the clear shallow waters and soaking up the sun, there are couple of points of interest for the more restless beachgoer.

The Blue Lagoon is a sheltered bay of dazzlingly turquoise shallow water that runs between Comino and the little uninhabited islet of Cominotto. Enclosed by the golden cliffs of Comino to one side and Cominotto to the other the Blue Lagoon is the perfect place for swimming and snorkeling. You can swim out to the island in relative safety and much of the lagoon is rope off to keep boats out. During the summer months there is a lifeguard here, however there can be stronger currents out of season so some care is advised. With ferries leaving from many of Malta’s major ports and harbours it is surprisingly easy to get to Comino. In fact the ferry from Cirkewwa on the northern tip of Malta’s main island only takes about 20 minutes. The Blue Lagoon is also on the itinerary of many boat trips. Despite its inherent beauty there are a few downsides to visiting the Blue Lagoon. Firstly, there is only a small patch of sand that you could really call a beach here. Add to this the fact that this is one of Malta’s most celebrated attractions and you can imagine how busy it gets. This is generally fine if you just want to spend your time in the water but if you want to spread out and soak up the sun it probably isn’t the best. On the subject of the sun it is worth noting there isn’t much in the way of shade here and the summer sun can be somewhat unrelenting.

Whether this is still a nude beach is hard to know - it seems also to be a secret! They only way to know for sure is to go for yourself.

Despite being so close to the North Island’s main city Piha remains relatively unspoilt. The beach backs onto the rugged and heavily forested coastline of the Waitakere Ranges which is a national park meaning the area hasn’t been over-developed. The sand along this stretch of coast is quite unusual in that not only is it black but is also magnetic. This is due to the high iron content which in turn relates to its volcanic origins. Piha’s black sand was produced by the eruption of the mighty Taupo volcano many milenia ago and is deposited along this coast by the Waikato River. There are other hints to New Zealand’s volcanic past at Piha. Set towards the southern end of the beach is the towering, iconic Lion Rock or Whakaari in Maori. It gets its name from the fact it looks a little like a lying lion from some angles although it is actually “volcanic plug” which dates back 16 million years. As the original and one of New Zealand’s best surfing beaches you can expect the sea to often be anything but calm. However, even on the calm days care should be taken as there can be strong, unpredictable rip currents at Piha.

While the only permanent residents of Totaranui Beach are staff from the Department of Conservation who manage it, it is extremely popular with holidaymakers from December to February, with the campsite on the opposite side of the gravel road providing pitches for up to 1000 campers.", "near_town_or_city": "Takaka", "weather": {"description": "(Cloudy)", "temperature": "13°C / 55°F", "sea-temperature": "15.6°C60.0°F"}, "rating": "Rating: 3/5 (0 votes cast)", "near_beaches": ["Awaroa Inlet (3 mi)", "Onetahuti (5 mi)", "Tata Beach (5 mi)", "Pohara Beach (6.4 mi)", "Bark Bay (7.1 mi)", "Abel Tasman National Park (9 mi)", "Torrent Bay (9.1 mi)", "Observation Beach (9.8 mi)", "Kaiteriteri Beach (15.3 mi)", "Kina Beach (23.5 mi)"], "country_rank": 42}, "Tunnel Beach": {"country": "New Zealand", "name": "Tunnel Beach", "description": "Less than eight kilometres southwest of the centre of Dunedin, close to St Clair on New Zealand’s South Island, Tunnel Beach is hidden from view by rugged sandstone cliffs rising 150 metres above the waves. Shaped by the might of the Pacific Ocean over millennia, the beach is studded with naturally-formed rock arches, caves, and a hand-hewn sloping tunnel that gives the beach both its name and its access to this day. Only open to the public since 1983, Tunnel Beach is accessed via the Department of Conservation Reserve. A path zigzags for more than a kilometre through publicly-accessible private farmland to the dimly-lit 72-step tunnel and on to the beach. It’s a journey that should take you around 20 minutes, and though it is generally suitable for all ages, it can be slippery after wet weather. Passing fossil remnants of long extinct sea creatures along the way, Tunnel Beach’s unique approach gives it an atmosphere and romance all of its own. And although this isn’t a beach to consider swimming from due to the strength of the rip currents, its amazing views means you’re sure to linger for longer than intended.", "near_town_or_city": "Dunedin", "weather": {"description": "(Clear sky)", "temperature": "7°C / 45°F", "sea-temperature": "12.3°C54.1°F"}, "rating": "Rating: 3/5 (0 votes cast)", "near_beaches": ["St Clair Beach (1.7 mi)", "Saint Kilda Beach (2.6 mi)", "Ocean Beach (3.1 mi)", "Tomahawk Beach (4.2 mi)", "Smaills Beach (5.1 mi)", "Boulder Beach (7.5 mi)", "Allans Beach (11.2 mi)", "Papanui Beach (14.2 mi)", "Victory Beach (14.5 mi)", "Long Beach (14.8 mi)"], "country_rank": 43}, "Whangapoua Beach": {"country": "New Zealand", "name": "Whangapoua Beach", "description": "Whangapoua Beach is located in the northeast of Great Barrier Island off Auckland.", "near_town_or_city": "Coromandel", "weather": {"description": "(Partly cloudy)", "temperature": "15.4°C / 60°F", "sea-temperature": "17.1°C62.7°F"}, "rating": "Rating: 3/5 (0 votes cast)", "near_beaches": ["Overtons Beach (4.3 mi)", "Stony Beach (5.9 mi)", "Palmers Beach (6.8 mi)", "Kaitoke Beach (8.1 mi)", "Medlands Beach (10.3 mi)"], "country_rank": 44}, "Bark Bay": {"country": "New Zealand", "name": "Bark Bay", "description": "Sitting on the border of Tonga Beach Marine Reserve within Abel Tasman National Park, Bark Bay (also called Wairima) is known for the reliability of its weather, offering sunshine pretty much all year round.

As if that wasn’t enough, El Nido is the largest marine sanctuary in the Philippines with turtles, sea cows and whale sharks all native. Located on the northeast shores of the El Nido region of the Palawan archipelago’s Matinloc Island, Hidden Beach takes its name from the fact its soft pale sands are all but invisible to passing boats. Situated within a small cove guarded by sheer cliffs, this tropical idyll provides a fantastic contrast to streets that roar with motorbike engines. The level arc of sand circles a shallow sea lagoon of extraordinary clarity, and is backed by a fusion of palms and rocks busy with birdsong. The only access to the beach is a quick swim, some of it over corals, adding to the feeling of arriving somewhere truly special. While growing in popularity, Hidden Beach’s isolated location means it’s rarely crowded, and those that do come tend to spend only around an hour here as part of a wider tour of the island’s treasures despite the obvious beauty.

They say that the name comes from World War II, when seven commandos were stranded here. There isn’t really any more information than that, or whether it is even true. Seven Commandos is a fairly secluded beach that can only be accessed by boat. As a result there are always boats anchored in the bay. Despite its location the beach is quite popular as it is a staple in the El Nido beach tours. Therefore there is a fairly constant stream of visitors, although most only spend an hour or two here. The beach is near El Nido, and it is often the first stop on the tour. The snorkeling is great here; with generally calm, clear waters and an abundance of reefs right off the shore you will have no trouble spotting some tropical marine life. You can also explore the rocks and the caves around this beach, but make sure you wear appropriate shoes as the rocks and reef can be tough on your feet.   A little further afield, straight across the water from Seven Commandos Beach is Miniloc Island which is home to some stunning lagoons. The imaginatively named Big Lagoon, Small Lagoon and the Secret Lagoon, are a must see and feature on many tours.

The other end of the island has a peppering of palm trees and is fringed with coral reef. The name of the island is the local Cebuano word for bird, which refers to its long, narrow, seagull-in-flight shape. Kalanggaman was declared a marine sanctuary in 2009 meaning it actually is as pristine as it looks. As well as offering some great snorkelling in the shallows around the island you may also spot dolphins here. However, most people who come to the island just come here to relax and soak up the picture perfect tropical vistas. Optional activities include bobbing around in the sea and lazing under palm trees! There is virtually nothing in the way of development on Kalanggaman Island; no bars, no resorts and not much in the way of other facilities.

When you arrive, you will be greeted with a long stretch of golden sand and clear turquoise waters. Beyond the coconut palms the backdrop is impressive with the heavily forested mountains rising up to the clouds.  The only resort here sits on one end of the beach, and there is a restaurant there. The resort has botanical gardens and a large beachfront with clear waters and a reef. There is also a small island just off the far end of the beach at Las cabanas, but you can get there by foot during low tide.  You might enjoy the the Palawan zipline for an adventure with phenomenal views. Alternatively just chill out and spend your time reading a book on the sand or swimming in the crystal clear waters.

Some beaches are quiet and backed by low dunes whilst others are more lively with beach bars pumping out music. Overall though, the vibe is laid back all along the coast. Perhaps the best known of Costa da Caparica’s beaches are Fonte da Telha, which is at the end of the line and Praia 19, which is the 19th stop on the train line. Fonte da Telha is a lively spot which was a small fishing village in a former life; people come here to hang out and party. Praia 19 on the other hand is renown internationally for being one of only a handful of nudist beaches in Portugal.

You need to cross a slippery path that can be dangerous, so this hike is not for everyone. However, once you see this spot for yourself, you will realize that it was worth the trip.  Anse Marron is something of a favourite for photographers and you will not want to miss the chance of snapping some shots of this beautiful spot. The boulders are dramatic, the water is an incredible crystal blue and the backdrop is verdant green. This beach doesn’t have a lot of visitors, so the unspoiled view is always stunning.", "near_town_or_city": "Victoria", "weather": {"description": "(Cloudy)", "temperature": "27.2°C / 81°F",

Development of the Golden Mile began back in the 1970s when it became one of the country’s biggest holiday destinations, largely owing to the subtropical winter sunshine and beautiful sandy beaches. The Golden Mile was largely redeveloped and modernized in time for the 2010 FIFA World Cup and now boasts international class attractions, such as the uShaka Marine World and any number of restaurants, bars and cafes. Today the golden sands of North Beach are backed by a palm lined promenade dotted with cafes and shops. Behind are the impressive modern facades of the high-rise hotels and apartment blocks that make Durban’s beachfront instantly recognisable. Should you ever get bored of the beach there are plenty of things for all the family within a stone’s throw. As mentioned is uShaka Marine World, the world’s fifth largest aquarium. Nearby is Mini Town, with its scale models of Durban landmarks and a the other end of the entertainment spectrum, the Suncoast Casino. Whilst to many Durban, and to some extent the rest of South Africa, are synonymous with sharks the beaches are relatively well protected here with shark nets and patrols.

Well around 40km (25 miles) around to Gordons Bay at the far end. Much of the shoreline is undeveloped and from most viewpoints there is a spectacular backdrop of the landmark mountains of Cape Town. As an aside, the name False Bay comes from early sailors confusing the bay with Table Bay on the west coast, which is home to Cape Town harbour. One of the most iconic features of Muizenberg beach are the brightly coloured Victorian beach huts which line the beach. Back in those days Muizenberg was Cape Town’s number one beach, however now-a-days it has been replaced by the likes of Clifton and Camps Bay as the place to be seen. Muizenberg is still probably the best family beach around though. Unlike the west coast beaches that face direct into the Atlantic Ocean, the beach here is wider and flatter; not only is the water much warmer (around 6°C) , but generally calmer. This makes Muizenberg the top spot to learn to surf at in the Cape Town area and there are plenty of surf schools here to help out with this at the “Surfer’s Corner” end of the beach. Whilst Muizenberg is a great swimming and surfing beach there have been a number of well reported shark attacks here over the years. Whilst this reflects the popularity of the beach and statistically you would be extremely unlucky to be attacked, the authorities do take the threat seriously.

Stretching for an incredible five kilometres, Playa Famara’s yellow sands never get crowded, though in places they are mixed with ancient volcanic pebbles from the massif of rock that overlooks the shore. Sometimes called the Hawaii of Europe, Playa Famara is a well-known surfing and bodyboarding spot. Generally speaking, the waves are best during the winter months, while the northern end of the beach has the fastest, most powerful waves. It’s also the northern end of the beach where naturists tend to sunbath. The strong surf means swimming any distance from the shore isn’t recommended. The wind that creates this surf can make the beach breezy, but you’ll find low stone-built U-shaped walls called zuco that provide protection.

What is more, there is nothing man-made here. There was until relatively recently a little chiringuito (beach bar) but that has since been removed. Some say this was an attempt to reduce the visitor numbers, but also possibly to restore the beach’s unspoiled natural charms. On the subject of returning to nature, Cala Varques is known as a spot for naturists. There is a little cove within the bay where you can find a bit more privacy. As we have alluded there is nothing in the way of facilities at Cala Varques. This means you will have to bring (and take away) everything you need for the day. Water is essential as are a decent pair of shoes as the hike down to the cove is quite rough going. There is no lifeguard either but the shallow, sheltered bay is generally very safe for swimming. The rugged coastline beyond the bay at Cala Varque has been shaped into some weird and wonderful forms over the milenia.

Along Playa de Migjorn’s length there are a few sections that stand out and are the most popular. To the far western end is Es Ca Marí, a pristine area of beach backed by pines and juniper. This is also the best place to eat with a few upmarket restaurants and chiringuitos tucked away amongst the trees. At the opposite end of the beach is Es Copinar, which also has a good selection of places to eat.

This means nothing has been built here and you can just enjoy the unspoilt views over the beach and out into the Mediterranean.  All this means there is very little in the way of amenities over on Espalmador so you will have to come prepared for a day at the beach and bring your own food and drinks. The main beach on Espalmador curves round a wide bay on the southern shores of the island. This provides a natural haven for yachts, and you will see plenty of these anchored here. For the rest of us, you will need to get a ferry, either from La Savina in Ibiza to the north, or from Playa Ses Illetes on Formentera. Whilst it may only seem like a stone’s throw from the tip of Formentera there are strong currents in the channel here so don’t be tempted to try and swim across. If lounging on the beach is too relaxing for you then a little exploring may be in order. Head towards the centre of the island and you will find a wide salty lake bed which is a twitcher’s paradise with any number of bird species to be found here.

The beach at Ribersborg very much has the feel of a park - which is no coincidence as this is how Ribersborgsstranden started out. During the 19th century the waterfront was developed as a recreational area with wide lawns perfect for picnicking and paths for walking. Over the following years a number of bathing piers were constructed to allow swimmers to easily enter the water, even at low tide. In total 10 piers were built, but the most notable is the northern pier with its impressive bathouse built in 1898. Completely renovated in 2009 the bathouse sits at the end of the pier and is home to a cafe, restuarant and suana. It also provides a number of various-sized, enclosed pools which offer safe bathing whatever the conditions. Ribersborg is actually an artificial beach with the sand being imported in the mid-1920s. But this is in keeping with the backdrop which is fairly urban, and a little industrial to the south.  During the summer holidays Ribersborgsstranden is always busy. It is a great family beach with plenty going on and lots of activities on offer. Summer programs feature regular events such as circus-style shows and activities like floating obstacle courses.

That said, this is hardly the place you would expect to find a tropical beach, bit that is exactly what you will find!

OK, before you get too excited, the temperatures may somewhat disappoint, as will the fact that the palm trees spend half of the year in greenhouses. But all the same this is the most popular beach in the area, and locals and visitors love it. The beach came into existence in the late 1800s when the harbour was built causing an area of sand to build up against the outside of the pier.

However, you don’t have to go to far off the beaten track to still find a pristine gem and the island of Koh Kradan is home to just such a beach.This stunning stretch of powdery white sand remain a relative haven despite being only a few kilometres off the mainland.  Ko Kradan is one of the Trang Islands, a group of around 40 large and small islands which form a major part of the Hat Chao Mai national park. Of all these islands and islets Koh Kradan is perhaps the most beautiful and largely unspoilt. Despite only being a couple of hours south of Phuket and even closer to Koh Phi Phi, Koh Kradan is a world apart, sharing all the natural beauty but without the crowds and noise. The waters of the Andaman Sea which surround the island are relatively sheltered and shallow, which means they are always warm i.e. ideal for swimming. On top of that they are crystal clear making for some excellent snorkelling in the protected waters. One thing to note though is the water is very shallow here at low tide and you’ll have to paddle quite a way before it’s deep enough to swim properly.\nFor those feeling particularly energetic there is a popular kayak route around the island which can be completed in less than 3 hours, even at a leisurely pace. For those looking to just relax and soak up the sun and calm Koh Kradan is perfect. There are numerous hammocks suspended between the palm trees that fringe the beach. The main beach at Koh Kradan is the aptly named east facing Paradise beach. However there is another, equally appropriately named, beach on the other coast. Easily reachable by a short trail through the forest is Sunset beach where you can enjoy a peaceful view of the sun setting over the Andaman Sea. Getting to Ko Kradan involves taking one of the ubiquitous long-tailed boats and these are available from several locations on the mainland or many of the other islands.

It is serenely beautiful and secluded - visitors can use various forms of public transport to reach it. With its calm, shallow waters gently lapping the dazzling sand, you will find little to do other than enjoy the warm, azure waters of the Caribbean, sun worship and relax while contemplating where on earth you would find a better spot. Since there is little by way of natural shade along Playa Paraiso’s approximate 2 miles of magnificent shoreline, it is worth claiming a spot by the collection of thatched umbrellas near the rustic bar-cum-eatery. The bar adds to the relaxed ambience and looks as if it has been in service since Robinson Crusoe went off in search of Friday - the man, rather than the day. If you should decide to go walking eastwards along the beach, you may bump into naturists enjoying things au natural - normal beach protocols apply.

It is also broad enough to accept four rows of beach chairs without users feeling like they are sitting on top of each other. Instead of sun loungers, the right-hand portion of Playa Guardalavaca when facing the aqua-coloured shallows are dominated by tree cover, offering some natural shade. Getting into the water couldn’t be easier thanks to a gentle draft, while most large incoming waves are prevented from coming ashore by a coral reef teeming with life. The waters are scanned by lifeguards during the summer months. Catamaran trips and jet ski rentals are common ways to explore when you tire of snorkelling. Masks and snorkels can be rented, while beach facilities include changing rooms, restrooms and showers.

The backdrop to the beach is stunning; the limestone peaks of Lycia rise up in the north whilst farmland dominates the plains below. This is a real nature lovers paradise with only dunes, wetlands and a river beyond the beach, in fact barely a trace of humanity. In fact you have to travel around a mile inland to the resort village of Gelemi if you are looking for anythng more indulgent than a snack.

Zones where the turtles lay their eggs are marked, and it is forbidden to disturb the nests in any way. In addition, no dogs are allowed on the beach. When you visit Iztuzu Beach, you have ample opportunity to learn all about the endangered Loggerhead turtles. The turtles lay their eggs between May and August, and the little turtles hatch from July to September and find their way back to the sea.

The beach at Holkham is a great expanse of fine golden white sand which stretches off in every direction. For England there is a rare feeling of massive space and wilderness. This is probably what inspired the director of the 1998 film “Shakespeare in Love” to use the beach in the final scene with Gwyneth Paltrow walking across the sands of a low tide, Holkham beach. The beach at Holkam is part of a nature reserve owned by the Earl of Leicester as part of his Holkham Estate. Backing onto windswept dunes, salt marshes and a pine forest the area is teeming with bird life. Pink-footed geese along with various finches and pipits are all visitors to Holkham.\nOne drawback to the beach’s status as a nature reserve is that barbecues aren’t allowed At low tide the walk to the sea is considerable. You’ll probably see dogs running like they’ve never run before and often horse riders skirting the surf.\nAt high tide Holkam is a very different place. The beach doesn’t feel so huge as the shoreline moves closer to the dunes and pine trees beyond. The high tide sand is different too; not like that further out which is perfect for making sand castles, but dry fine sand covered in broken sea shells. As the tide comes back in a shallow basin in the sand fills with water forming a lagoon. In recent years there has been a deal of controversy about Holkham’s useas a naturist beach. The estate tried to enforce a ban on nudity but British Naturism threatened legal action after which this was lifted. However, there are still restrictions with the sand dunes behind the beach being out of bounds to nudists.

There are green sea turtles and around 400 species of fish including parrotfish, tang, butterfly fish and Hawaii’s national fish, the Humuhumunukunukuapua’a. Given all this it is no surprise that Hanauma Bay is a Nature Preserve and a Marine Life Conservation District. This is a far cry from the 1950s when a channel was blasted in the coral reef to make way for a telephone cable. Today the bay is protected in a number of ways and from its own popularity; feeding of the fish is prohibited as is touching the coral.To further help protect Hanauma Bay visitors are charged for entry and the beach is closed on Tuesdays.

The first thing to point out about the park and the beaches is you may be disappointed if you are expecting the coral reefs to be right off the sand. John Pennekamp state park covers an area of around 70 nautical square miles and extends over 3 miles into the ocean. Truth is that stunning coral is a fair way out to sea and you’ll need a boat to get there. There are two main beaches in the park; Cannon beach and Far beach. The best of these is Cannon beach which get its name from a pair of 17th century cannons which now overlook the beach. These came from a ship which was wrecked not far off the shore and more cannons and the anchor can still be seen if you snorkel out to the buoy. The snorkeling off Cannon beach isn’t great and the water can often be a little murky. It certainly doesn’t compare to the world class diving further out. What the beach does offer though is a pleasant space to spend some time in with a small area of parkland behind and basic amenities. We wouldn’t necessary recommend planning your day around the beach, but it makes a great spot to relax between activities. Neighboring Far beach is somewhat smaller. It has a similar sprinkling of imported sand and is dotted with palm trees, which can provide some shade.

The beach runs along much of San Francisco’s westerly suburb, the aptly named Sunset.

It’s generally a miss during the summer months when the fog tends to roll in early morning and late afternoon, which is also when the wind picks up. In fact the best time to visit is any time except the summer! As the name suggests, Ocean Beach faces due west into the Pacific. This means there can often be powerful waves, which combined with strong rip currents make the beach notoriously dangerous. So dangerous in fact that there are no lifeguards on duty as no one should be going in the water. If that isn’t enough to put you off taking a dip then the water temperature may well - even in the summer the water is freezing. Oh, and did we mention the odd great white shark sighting! With all those waves it is little surprise that Ocean Beach is well known as a surf spot. On its day it can be world class but conditions can often be challenging including an infamously hard paddle out when it gets bigger. To some extent this helps prevent less experienced surfers getting into too much trouble, but this really isn’t a spot for beginners. Dogs are allowed off leash on the northern end of the beach, but must be kept on the leash at the southern end.

On the facilities front, there are no bars or restaurants to grab food and drink from so you’ll need to bring your own snacks if you’re setting up camp for the day.

On the dining front, if you like your dinner with a view, then Main Street Pier’s a must-visit. It juts out into the Atlantic, and there’s a crab shack at the end, if you’re into fresh seafood.  And perhaps most intriguingly of all with Daytona Beach is the ability to take your car on to it. Of course, the tides play their part in deciding when you can go on there, and there are strict guidelines when it comes to speed limits and designated driving areas, but if you fancy taking the car for a spin and pulling up right by your sunbathing spot then it’s possible here.", "near_town_or_city": "Daytona Beach", "weather": {"description": "(Cloudy)", "temperature": "22°C / 72°F", "sea-temperature": "20.5°C68.9°F"}, "rating": "Rating: 3/5 (0 votes cast)", "near_beaches": ["Ormond Beach (5.9 mi)", "New Smyrna Beach (14.6 mi)", "Flagler Beach (19.6 mi)"], "country_rank": 272}, "Pensacola Beach": {"country": "USA", "name": "Pensacola Beach", "description": "Stretching for several miles along the state’s Gulf of Mexico coastline, Pensacola Beach forms the main proportion of Santa Rosa Island.

The airfield and beach were also used in filming the TV show ‘LOST’ between 2004 and 2010.", "near_town_or_city": "Mokulēia", "weather": {"description": "(Partly cloudy)", "temperature": "25°C / 77°F", "sea-temperature": "26.2°C79.1°F"}, "rating": "Rating: 3/5 (0 votes cast)", "near_beaches": ["Polo Beach (2.1 mi)", "Yokohama Bay (3.8 mi)", "Mākua Beach (4.1 mi)", "Haleiwa Beach Park (6 mi)", "Laniakea Beach (7.3 mi)", "Chuns Reef Beach (7.9 mi)", "Waimea Bay (9.3 mi)", "Three Tables (9.5 mi)", "Shark's Cove (9.7 mi)", "Pupukea Beach Park (9.9 mi)"], "country_rank": 309}, "Polo Beach": {"country": "USA", "name": "Polo Beach", "description": "Located near the western corner of Oahu’s North Shore, not far from Haleiwa, is this lovely little pristine stretch of sand.

Often as not the beach here will be empty but don’t be surprised to see horses being ridden on the beach - after all it is named for the Polo Club next door. The water here is an enticing turquoise color and Polo beach is generally more sheltered than other spots on the North Shore. That said there are no lifeguards here so always take care and check the conditions before entering the sea. This is a great spot for wildlife watching; time it right and you might spot migrating whales off the coast whilst monk seals and sea turtles can be seen year-round. With its air of seclusion, Polo beach has been considered clothing-optional for many years. There has been some friction with local residents over recent years so it is recommended that you stay further out of view towards the eastern end of the beach if you do want to nude sunbathe.", "near_town_or_city": "Mokulēia", "weather": {"description": "(Heavy rain)", "temperature": "23.3°C / 74°F", "sea-temperature": "25.8°C78.4°F"}, "rating": "Rating: 3/5 (0 votes cast)", "near_beaches": ["Mokuleia Beach Park (2.1 mi)", "Haleiwa Beach Park (4 mi)", "Laniakea Beach (5.4 mi)", "Mākua Beach (5.5 mi)", "Yokohama Bay (5.7 mi)", "Chuns Reef Beach (6 mi)", "Waimea Bay (7.6 mi)", "Three Tables (7.8 mi)", "Shark's Cove (8 mi)", "Pupukea Beach Park (8.2 mi)"], "country_rank": 310}, "Apollo Beach": {"country": "USA", "name": "Apollo Beach", "description": "Located on Florida’s eastern Atlantic coastline in New Smyrna, Apollo Beach is on the Canaveral National Seashore (National Park). Great for beach lovers, it has an endless strip of pristine golden sand and, being more secluded, it is one of the top nudist beaches in Florida. (This should not to be confused with the other Apollo Beach on Florida’s Gulf Coast near Tampa!)  Located on a barrier island, Apollo Beach is 10 miles south of New Smyrna Beach. The beautiful soft white sand stretches for 5 miles and is actually made up of crushed coquina.  The beach is washed by strong Atlantic rollers, which means there are strong currents and the potential for rough surf.  The park has 5 dedicated parking lots that fill up fast in the high season (November through April) and once the gates are closed no-one else is allowed onto the beach. There is a parking and access fee for anyone aged 16 and above and the beach is usually open from 6am to 8pm, or dusk if sooner. You need to walk several hundred yards from the parking lot over a ramp to the sand so you need to carry everything with you.  There are restrooms at Apollo Beach but no shops or food stands, keeping this area natural and unspoilt.  If you plan to strip off, naturist sunbathing is only allowed south of Parking Lot 5 at the north end of the beach. Signs are posted showing when you are on the clothing-optional area.  The beach is perfect for long walks along the shoreline, surf fishing, hiking, surfing, sunbathing and ball games. There’s a boat ramp and nature trail from Parking Lot 3. It’s also a haven for wildlife including nesting turtles, gopher tortoises and brown pelicans.", "near_town_or_city": "Oak Hill", "weather": {"description": "(Partly cloudy)", "temperature": "22.6°C / 73°F", "sea-temperature": "20.9°C69.7°F"}, "rating": "Rating: 1/5 (1 votes cast)", "near_beaches": ["Klondike Beach (10.4 mi)", "New Smyrna Beach (12.3 mi)", "Playalinda Beach (17.9 mi)", "Titusville Beach (22.8 mi)"], "country_rank": 311}, "Harris Beach": {"country": "USA", "name": "Harris Beach", "description": "Appropriately, Harris Beach is located within Harris Beach State Park, on Oregon’s rugged southern coastline.

Also relatively wide, a small gentle stream flows into the Pacific Ocean here, making it an attractive place for young children to play with a fishing net. However, there’s no net big enough for the creatures that migrate along this area of coastline beyond the rocky sea stacks just offshore. Gray whales are frequent visitors during the winter and spring months. Harbour seals and sealions also inhabit the area, while Bird Island is a breeding ground for rare species including the Tufted Puffin. Though facilities at Harris Beach are limited, there are a handful of picnic tables and also public rest rooms. There is a camping ground suitable for those with tents and RVs just a couple of hundred metres away, sheltered by trees. If you want to enter the water, you’ll have to cross the rocky waterline, which reveal tidal pools full of life at low tide.

There’s plenty of opportunity to sit beside the lake and soak up the surroundings from the half-mile curving sand beach, with sun lounger and umbrella rentals and a beach cocktail service.
